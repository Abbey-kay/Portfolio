# Creative Producer

### Bio
I’m a creative film producer with a deep commitment to reshaping the African film landscape. My work blends the innovative spirit of storytelling with the strategic focus of my background in Economics, Strategic Leadership, and Management. This unique combination allows me to approach film production with both creativity and a clear focus on sustainability.

Beyond producing, I’m also diving into research on the growth of emerging film industries, particularly in Botswana. My goal is to champion underrepresented voices by integrating inclusive innovation and transformative business models. Through collaboration with diverse filmmakers, I’m working to craft authentic, thought-provoking stories that not only entertain but challenge and inspire audiences to rethink their world. Together, we’re building a more equitable, thriving film industry that reflects Africa’s rich narrative potential.
